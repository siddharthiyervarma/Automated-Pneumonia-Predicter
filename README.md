## Computer Vision and Neural Networks: Predicting Pneumonia in X-ray Images

This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to predict lung disease, specifically pneumonia, from chest X-ray images. By employing a pre-trained VGG16 model and incorporating data augmentation, the project aims to create a robust binary classification model. The comprehensive evaluation includes accuracy, recall, F1 score, specificity, AUC-ROC, and MCC, ensuring a thorough understanding of the model's diagnostic capabilities. The ultimate goal is to contribute a valuable tool for medical image analysis with potential applications in healthcare.
